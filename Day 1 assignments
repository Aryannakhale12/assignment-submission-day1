Q1). Difference between compiler and interpreter?
And--- 
Compiler:: It goes through entire program and then translate full program to machine language at once.
           If any error are there it will show at last when full code runs.
           It require source code of execution.
           The execution time of complier is very less than interpreter.
           Eg-- C, C++

Interpreter::  It execute the code line by line and convert single line to machine language.
               If any errors occur interpreter show the error after every line execution.
               It doesn't require source code, it can process single line code also.
               The execution time of interpreter is too slow as it goes line by line.
               Eg-- python, PHP
